In the last couple of months, I noticed that my private laptop certainly has a finite lifetime. Thinking about the requirements a new one has to stand up to, I realized that developing and supporting *Google Test Adapter* has in the last years been one of the major use cases of that laptop. Thus, I decided to take this as reason for from now on accepting donations :-)

Therefore, if you would like to appreciate development and support of *Google Test Adapter*, **please consider to [donate!](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#donations)** Thanks in advance...

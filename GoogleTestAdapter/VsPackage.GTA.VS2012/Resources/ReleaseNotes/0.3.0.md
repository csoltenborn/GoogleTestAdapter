* enhancement: added support for [TestCaseFilters](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vikramagrawal/archive/2012/07/23/running-selective-unit-tests-in-vs-2012-rc-using-testcasefilter.aspx) ([#26](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/26))
* enhancement: added C++ macros for using traits with typed tests ([#14](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/14))
* enhancement: placeholder for executable can now be used within the additional test executable arguments ([#4](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/4))
* enhancement: GTA now comes with pre-configured [Child Process Debugging Power Tool](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1141bff-463f-465f-9b6d-d29b7b503d7a) - no need for development mode or manually attaching to processes any more when developing GTA ([#20](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/20))
* bugfix: added workaround for a VS bug which could result in lost test results ([#15](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/15), thanks to [Alfred5020](https://github.com/Alfred5020) and [Dominik Grabiec](https://github.com/DominikGrabiec) for debugging)
* bugfix: no test names were reported to `VS.Test.Console` and TFS ([#25](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/25), thanks to [Dima Sirotnikov](https://github.com/sirotnikov) for report and fix)
* bugfix: `SequentialTestRunner` invoked `CommandLineGenerator` with all tests of all executables, resulting in command line arguments longer than necessary ([#18](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/18), thanks to [Dominik Grabiec](https://github.com/DominikGrabiec) for report and fix)
* project structure: renamed solutions and projects
* quality assurance: provided end-to-end tests making use of `VsTest.Console.exe`

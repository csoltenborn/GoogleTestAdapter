First of all: We proudly announce the [collaboration with Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/05/10/unit-testing-and-the-future-announcing-the-test-adapter-for-google-test/) with the aim of further improving the Google Test experience in Visual Studio! The benefits for users of Google Test are various, the most important being that a version of the *Google Test Adapter* will ship with Visual Studio, making it even easier to use Google Test out of the box. This version (named *Test Adapter for Google Test*) is [published by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualCPPTeam.TestAdapterforGoogleTest), and will thus benefit from Microsoft's quality assurance resources (which are slightly bigger than ours).

Thus, there will be two versions of the adapter in the future:
* The *Google Test Adapter* is published by us. It will support Visual Studio 2012 and greater, and is supposed to be the *bleeding edge* version where new features are implemented and tested.
* The *Test Adapter for Google Test* is published by Microsoft as part of Visual Studio. It will support Visual Studio 2017 and greater and is supposed to be the more mature version of the adapter.

We will in the coming weeks integrate our latest release with the enhancements implemented by Microsoft, and figure out the details of our collaboration. If your are interested, keep an eye on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter).

Changes contained in this version:
* enhancement: a Visual Studio bug results in wrong behavior for *Repeat Last Run (Ctrl+R, L)*: VS does not respect changes to the available tests since the last run. Tests which do not exist any more as well as test results for tests not known by VS are now ignored and produce a warning in debug mode. Note that VS still might run other tests than expected by the user - see issue for examples ([#139](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/139))
* bugfix: solution settings were overridden by project settings in case of `NuGet` and `VsTestConsole` execution ([#140](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/140))
* bugfix: occasional exceptions caused by missing synchronization when performing test discovery in parallel ([#141](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/141))
* bugfix: NuGet package had installation issue ([#137](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/137), thanks to [JackGrinningCat](https://github.com/JackGrinningCat) for report, idea for fix, and testing)
* bugfix: test duration could not be parsed for some locales ([#143](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/143))

* enhancement: option *PATH extension* now supports placeholder *$(ExecutableDir)* ([#66](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/66), thanks to [cyrilbesse](https://github.com/cyrilbesse) for request and testing)
* enhancement: new option *Working directory* allows to specify the working directory used when running the test executables ([#71](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/71))
* enhancement: traits assigned to tests by means of regexes now also work in an additive manner, improving consistency of traits assignment accross trait assignment phases. Note that this might change the traits assigned to your tests - see issue for details. See also note below ([#73](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/73))
* enhancement: GTA can now also handle tests written with older versions of Google Test which do not print type and value parameter information when listing tests ([#68](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/68))
* enhancement: settings are now printed to test output if GTA is running in debug mode ([#60](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/60))
* enhancement: cleaned up log output a bit ([#62](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/62))
* bugfix: if listing of tests failed, GTA produces a warning now, and no further efforts are taken to parse SourceFileLocations ([#63](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/63), thanks to [Sergey Gomon](https://github.com/gomons) for example solution)
* bugfix: if a test crashed, but produced output immediately before the crash, that output would not end up in the test explorer ([#58](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/58))
* quality assurance: improved stability of end-to-end tests ([#61](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/61))

**Request for feedback:** We would like to know whether any of our users indeed make use of the *trait assignment by regexes* options! If you happen to use that feature, please do us a favor and leave a short note at [this issue](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/75) - if nobody does, we might remove that option for the sake of configuration and code simplicity...

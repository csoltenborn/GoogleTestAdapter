* enhancement: Google Test executables are identified automatically by investigating the binaries - custom regexes should not be necessary any more ([#121](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/121))
* enhancement: Support for parameterized tests with name functors ([#150](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/150), thanks to [Shane Blackett](https://github.com/wasabinza) for report and pull request)
* enhancement: Google Test reports the duration of tests faster than 0.5ms as 0ms. These tests are now reported to VS with a duration of 0.25ms, hopefully being more realistic than the former 0.1ms ([#166](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/166))
* enhancement: release notes are now delivered from installation folder, slightly reducing dll size ([#165](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/165))
* bugfix: error messages containing source file locations do not confuse the error message parser any more ([#157](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/157))
* maintenance: improved NuGet package structure ([#144](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/144), thanks to Microsoft's Jayarani Garg and Huy Nguyen for advice)

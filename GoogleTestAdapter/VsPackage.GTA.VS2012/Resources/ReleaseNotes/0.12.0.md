* enhancement: many enhancements emerging from the collaboration with Microsoft have made it into this release - thanks, Microsoft (and [Lukasz Mendakiewisz](https://github.com/LukaszMendakiewicz) in particular)!
  * the GTA toolbar has new (and more appropriate) icons
  * test discovery has been slightly accelerated
  * the origin of test executables is verified before running them - if they have not been created on the local machine, they will be ignored with a warning
  * settings and test duration files are now validated against their respective XML schema
  * dependencies on 3rd party libraries have been reduced
* bugfix: under very special circumstances, test executables containing spaces in their paths could not be run ([TAFGT #18](https://github.com/Microsoft/TestAdapterForGoogleTest/issues/18), thanks to [Lukasz Mendakiewisz](https://github.com/LukaszMendakiewicz) for fix)
* maintenance: The solution structure has been changed to allow building of the GTA as well as the TAfGT flavor of the extension while sharing the vast majority of the code. As a side effect, the build process has become slightly more complicated; contributors are pointed to the [wiki](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/wiki/Development-Knowledge-Base#initial-setup). Thanks to Microsoft's [Lukasz Mendakiewisz](https://github.com/LukaszMendakiewicz) for making most of this happen!

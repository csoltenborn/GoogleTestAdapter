* enhancement: the location of the pdb file is now also looked up within the according test executable, providing source locations and traits even in cases were the pdb's name is different from the name of the test executable, or where the pdb ends up outside of the executable's path ([#45](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/pull/45), thanks to [Stefan Winkler](https://github.com/nafest) for the pull request)
* enhancement: options are now grouped into categories ([#44](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/44))
* enhancement: release notes are shown after the extension has been updated ([#48](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/48))
* bugfix: if [Dia crashed](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1908082/dia140-fails-in-various-ways-when-using-debug-fastlink), the pdb under analysis remained locked, and the tests contained in the according test executable were not found (part of [#46](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/46), thanks to [Jesse Olmer](https://github.com/JesseOlmer) for report and example solution)

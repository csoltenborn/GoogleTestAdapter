* enhancement: GTA can now also be used with the standalone version of `VsTest.Console.exe` pulled in via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TestPlatform) ([#216](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/216), thanks to [Satya Madala](https://github.com/smadala) for report and testing)
* enhancement: Settings files can now be provided via environment variable `GTA_FALLBACK_SETTINGS`. This is a workaround for [#184](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/184); the referred settings file will be used *only* if GTA fails to receive settings from the VS test framework. Currently, this is only known to happen when running GTA through `VsTest.Console.exe` on VS 2017 V15.5 and later ([#212](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/212))
* enhancement: options *Working directory*, *Test setup batch file*, *Test teardown batch file*, *Additional PDBs*, *PATH extension*, and *Additional test execution parameters* now support the usage of environment variables (to be provided in the form `%VAR_NAME%`). Not that this is a **breaking change**: *Test setup batch file* and *Test teardown batch file* have until now been interpreted locally to the solution directory. This is not the case any more. If you use these options, prefix your current setting with `$(SolutionDir)` to maintain the old behavior ([#202](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/202), thanks to [dmcminn](https://github.com/dmcminn) for report and testing)
* enhancement: the `$(SolutionDir)` placeholder is now also available during test discovery ([#214](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/214), thanks to [Lysann Schlegel](https://github.com/lysannschlegel) for report and testing)
* enhancement: *Working directory* and *Additional test execution parameters* options are also in effect now during test discovery ([#214](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/214), thanks to [Lysann Schlegel](https://github.com/lysannschlegel) for report and testing)
* enhancement: The new option *Additional PDBs* allows to provide additional PDBs for finding source file locations. This is useful if GTA is not able to find the according PDBs automatically ([#153](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/153), thanks to [Tony](https://github.com/sephirostoy) for report and testing)
* enhancement: added option *Skip check of file origin* for cases where the test executable is not on the local machine. Note that this option can only be set via VS Options - values in settings files will be ignored for security reasons ([#179](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/179), thanks to [Dominic van Berkel](https://github.com/barometz) for report and testing)
* bugfix: the test executable's working directory is now set to the directory containing that executable during test discovery; the same holds during test execution in case *Working directory* is left blank ([#188](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/188), thanks to [DOTTEL Ga&euml;l](https://github.com/pifopi) for testing)
* bugfix: GTA could not handle test runs with lots of gtest suites to be executed ([#192](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/192), thanks to [MartinOSchmidt](https://github.com/MartinOSchmidt) for report and pull request)
* bugfix: *Working dir* and *Additional test execution params* options had no effect if provided through project settings nodes
 ([#214](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/214), thanks to [Lysann Schlegel](https://github.com/lysannschlegel) for report, suggestion for fix, and testing)
* bugfix: GTA was not able to figure out the Visual Studio version under some circumstances ([#204](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/204), thanks to [zahirtezcan-bugs](https://github.com/zahirtezcan-bugs) for report and pull request)

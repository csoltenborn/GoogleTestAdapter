* enhancement: new option *Google Test/Break on failure* allows to break at assertion failures if debugger is attached, default is `false` ([#32](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/32))
* enhancement: new option *Google Test/Catch exceptions* allows to let the Google Test framework catch exceptions and continue with the remaining tests, default is `true` ([#31](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/31))
* enhancement: new option *General/PATH extension* allows to extend the `PATH` variable passed to the test executables ([#28](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/28), thanks to [loki980](https://github.com/loki980) for report, debugging and testing)
* enhancement: assertion failures are linked to their source locations via *Stacktrace* section of details panel ([#27](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/27), thanks to [Eistroll](https://github.com/Eistroll) for testing)
* enhancement: added support for [SCOPED_TRACE](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/AdvancedGuide.md#adding-traces-to-assertions)s, which are linked to their source locations via *Stacktrace* section of details panel ([#30](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/30), thanks to [Eistroll](https://github.com/Eistroll) for testing)
* enhancement: tests which were skipped due to a crashing test now link to that test ([#33](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/33))
* bugfix: GTA couldn't be installed if only .NET 4.6 was available ([#29](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/29), thanks to [Achim Stremplat](https://github.com/RaymondKHessel) for report and fix)

Note that the GTA options have been restructured (the *Advanced* section is gone, Google Test options have been moved to new section *Google Test*), resulting in lost settings of the moved options within VS. Solution and user file settings are not affected.

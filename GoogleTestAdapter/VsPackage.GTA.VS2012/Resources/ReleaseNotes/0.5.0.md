* enhancement: the most important runtime options (i.e., *Parallel test execution*, *Break on failure*, *Catch exceptions*, and *Print test output*) can now also be set via a toolbar; this is equivalent to setting the according options via *Tools/Options/Google Test Adapter* ([#37](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/37))
* enhancement: new option *Test name separator* allows to replace the `/` within Google Test names (which causes VS to truncate test names if the test explorer window is not wide enough) with another string ([#23](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/23))
* enhancement: new option *Parse symbol information* allows to switch off parsing of the tests' .pdb files (which speeds up test discovery for the cost of having no test source locations and no macro based traits) ([#41](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/41), thanks to [Peter Budai](https://github.com/peterbudai) for the pull request)
* enhancement: license is now provided in a more standardized way ([#40](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/40), thanks to [Peter Budai](https://github.com/peterbudai)) 
* bugfix: traits information had been optimized away by certain compiler optimizations ([#39](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/39))

* **breaking change:** setup and tear down batch files are now executed from within the solution directory
* **breaking change:** we have changed the assembly signing key and versioning schema. This apparently has two unintended consequences:
  * VS disables the extension. Action: just re-enable it and perform the update.
  * VS looses your configurations under *Options/Google Test Adapter*. Action: Re-configure GTA, possibly making use of the new file-based configuration possibilities.
* enhancement: test settings can now be provided via configuration files ([#2](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/2))
* enhancement: support for Visual Studio 2013
* bugfix: test directory did not get deleted if non-empty
* bugfix: X64 and VS2013 loggers would crash if invoked with empty message
* bugfix: console output of passing tests is now ignored

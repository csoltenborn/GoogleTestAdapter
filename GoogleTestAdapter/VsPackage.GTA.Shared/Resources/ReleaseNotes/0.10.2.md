* bugfix: missing `.pdb` files could cause test discovery to crash, resulting in no tests being found ([#158](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/158), thanks to [wasabinza](https://github.com/wasabinza) and [burbelgruff](https://github.com/burbelgruff) for report and fix)
* enhancement: added support for .NET 4.7 ([#161](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/161))

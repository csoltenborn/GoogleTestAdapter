* enhancement: support for [Google Test V1.8.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/586) ([#103](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/103))
* enhancement: file `Foo.exe` is recognized as test executable if a file `Foo.exe.is_google_test` exists (no need to configure custom regex) ([#121](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/121))
* enhancement: test discovery is assumed to [hang](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/84) if it hasn't finished within `n` seconds; `n` can be configured via the *Test discovery timeout* option and defaults to 30s  ([#90](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/90))
* enhancement: test discovery is now performed in parallel and should thus be slightly faster for solutions with several test projects ([#108](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/108))
* enhancement: test case information is now re-used when a selection of tests is executed, slightly speeding up the start of the tests ([#107](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/107))
* bugfix: standard output produced by a test executable before a test's first assertion was lost ([#134](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/134))
* bugfix: on isolated installations of VS 2017 (i.e., no parallel installation of older VS versions on the same machine), no source locations were found ([#124](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/124), thanks to [Farwaykorse](https://github.com/Farwaykorse) for report and testing)
* bugfix: on isolated installations of VS2017, tests could not be debugged ([#126](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/126), thanks to [ninjaCoder](https://github.com/ninjaCoder) for report and testing)
* maintenance: all executables used by the automatic tests are now built from source ([#132](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/132))
* maintenance: solution can be built with VS 2015 and VS 2017 to ease contributions ([#109](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/109))

* enhancement: Support for VisualStudio 2012 and 2017 has been added ([#9](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/9), [#93](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/93))
* enhancement: throttling of test result reporting has been switched off for VS2017 ([#105](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/105))
* enhancement: new option *Kill processes after cancel* actively kills the test execution processes if the test run is canceled ([#3](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/3))
* enhancement: test durations less than 1ms are now displayed as such in the VS test explorer ([#104](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/104))
* bugfix: we are working on removing the difference between running and debugging tests (e.g., test crash detection is not working, and test output can not be printed to test console in debug mode). Additionally, the new test execution environment reports test results to VS during test execution, giving a slightly faster and more responsive user experience. It can be used by setting the *Use new test exexution environment* option to *true* (which is now the default value) and should now also work fine when debugging in X64 mode. Feel free to give it a try; if you encounter any problems, please report them to us ([#76](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/76))
* bugfix: GTA had issues running within `vstest.console.exe` for x64 executables ([#21](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/21))
* bugfix: reference to LICENSE.txt has been fixed in NuGet specification ([#96](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/96), thanks to [JackGrinningCat](https://github.com/JackGrinningCat) for report and fix)
* bugfix: the VS test framework throws a `TestCanceledException` if test results are being reported after a test run has been canceled. This exception is now handled properly ([#99](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/99))
* simplification: the option to assign traits via regexes has been removed due to [lack of usage](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/75) ([#94](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/94))

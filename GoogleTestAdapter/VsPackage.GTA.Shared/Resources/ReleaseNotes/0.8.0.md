* enhancement: it is now also possible to provide project-specific settings. Project settings are contained within solution and/or user settings files and assigned to projects via regular expressions matched against the test executables; see example [solution settings](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/blob/master/SampleTests/SampleTests.gta.runsettings) and [user settings](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/blob/master/SampleTests/NonDeterministic.runsettings). **Note that this is a breaking change:** the XML format of solution and user settings has been changed in the course of implementing this feature; see below for instructions on how to update your settings files ([#74](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/74))
* enhancement: the restriction that tests can be run on at most as much threads as there are available processors has been removed ([#80](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/80))
* enhancement: if running a test executable fails, GTA now gives more helpful error messages, additionally, all errors and warnings are printed again after test discovery/test execution finished ([#91](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/91))
* enhancement: when tests are executed in parallel, some simple statistics about expected and actual test durations (which influence test distribution) are printed in debug mode ([#81](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/81))
* enhancement: GTA can now also run tests having dots in suite names (and produced by using the Google Test API) ([#89](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/89), thanks to [Florin T.](https://github.com/ftrofin) for report and sample code)
* enhancement: GTA is now also provided as a NuGet package. Adding it as dependency of Google Test projects enables Visual Studio to discover and run tests; however, Visual Studio integration is limited, since options and toolbar are not available if installed this way ([#77](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/77))
* enhancement: we are working on removing the difference between running and debugging tests (e.g., test crash detection is not working, and test output can not be printed to test console in debug mode). Additionally, the new test execution environment reports test results to VS during test execution, giving a slightly faster and more responsive user experience. A first version can be used by setting the *Use new test exexution environment* option to *true*; it should work fine **except debugging in X64 mode**. Feel free to give it a try; if you encounter any problems, please report them to us ([#76](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/76))
* bugfix: GTA can now deal with special characters (e.g., German umlauts) in test names, test suite names and prefixes, and value parameters ([#72](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/72))
* bugfix: standard output parser can now deal with tests where one test's qualified name is be a prefix of another test's qualified name ([#82](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/82))
* maintainability: refactored test project structure, added references to projects of SampleTests solution to main solution ([#82](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/82))


##### Instructions for updating settings files
The new XML format is structured as follows:

```xml
<RunSettings>
  <GoogleTestAdapterSettings>
    <SolutionSettings>
      <Settings>
        <!-- solution settings -->
      </Settings>
    </SolutionSettings>
    <ProjectSettings>
      <Settings ProjectRegex="regex matching test executables">
        <!-- project specific settings -->
      </Settings>
      <!-- more project settings -->
    </ProjectSettings>
  </GoogleTestAdapterSettings>
</RunSettings>
```

To update your solution and user settings, do as follows:
* copy the complete `<GoogleTestAdapterSettings>` node from above into your settings' `<RunSettings>` node
* copy the settings from the old `<GoogleTestAdapter>` node to the new `<Settings>` node under  `<SolutionSettings>`
* replace the complete `<ProjectSettings>` node with an empty  `<ProjectSettings/>` node (or create actual project settings if needed)
* delete the complete `<GoogleTestAdapter>` node
* do not forget to check in your changes if appropriate

Refer to [documentation of settings](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#gta_settings) for more detailed description of project settings.

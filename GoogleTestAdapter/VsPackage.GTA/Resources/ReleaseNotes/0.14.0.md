* enhancement: new placeholders `$(PlatformName)` and `$(ConfigurationName)` are available ([#170](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/170))
* enhancement: the option *Use new test execution framework (experimental)* has been renamed into *Use native debugging*. It now only affects debugging of tests: native debuging supports test crash detection and printing test output ([#106](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/106))
* bugfix: tests without source location did not receive traits by regex ([#249](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/249))
* bugfix: user-provided regexes could run forever ([#239](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/239))
* maintenance: code coverage has been improved ([#247](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/247), thanks to [frboyer](https://github.com/frboyer) for pull request)
* maintenance: the SampleTests solution now uses [Google Test 1.8.1](https://github.com/abseil/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.8.1) ([#248](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/248))

**Announcement:** Microsoft has decided to force VS extensions to make use of [asynchronous package loading](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2018/05/16/improving-the-responsiveness-of-critical-scenarios-by-updating-auto-load-behavior-for-extensions/). Since they only provide backwards compatibility for this down to VS2013, 0.14.* will be **the last version with support for VS2012**. Support for asynchronous package loading will be added in the next version of GTA.

Changes in this version:
* enhancement: GTA can now also be installed into Visual Studio 2019 ([#243](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/243))

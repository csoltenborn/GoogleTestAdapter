**Announcement:** Microsoft has decided to force VS extensions to make use of [asynchronous package loading](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2018/05/16/improving-the-responsiveness-of-critical-scenarios-by-updating-auto-load-behavior-for-extensions/). Since they only provide backwards compatibility for this down to VS2013, 0.14.* will be **the last version with support for VS2012**. Support for asynchronous package loading will be added in the next version of GTA.

Changes in this version:
* enhancement: GTA now also supports the (not yet released) macro `GTEST_SKIP()` ([#260](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/260), thanks to [Sixten Hilborn](https://github.com/sixten-hilborn) for report and testing)
* bugfix: some broken links of the README have been fixed ([#257](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/257) and [#258](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/258), thanks to [Jim Orcheson](https://github.com/jimorc) for report and pull request)

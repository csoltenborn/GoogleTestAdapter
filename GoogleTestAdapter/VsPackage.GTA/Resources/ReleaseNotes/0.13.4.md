* bugfix: there seem to be problems with the latest versions of Visual Studio and [Visual Assist](https://forums.wholetomato.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15272) which also affect GTA; it should now handle such problems gracefully ([#246](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/246), thanks to my colleague SH for providing useful information)

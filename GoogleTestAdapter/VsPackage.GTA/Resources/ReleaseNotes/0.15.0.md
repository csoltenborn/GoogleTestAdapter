Changes in this version:
* enhancement: setting the new option [*Exit code test name*](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#evaluating_exit_code) results in an additional test per test executable that passes if the executable's exit code is 0, and fails otherwise. Additionally, GTA parses the test executable's output for certain [tokens](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#evaluating_exit_code_tokens) which allow to influence the test's outcome and message. One interesting use case for this is memory leak detection; a complete, reusable [example](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#evaluating_exit_code_leak_example) is provided as part of GTA's [SampleTests solution](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/tree/master/SampleTests) ([#266](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/266), thanks to [alfredskpoon](https://github.com/alfredskpoon) for report, example code, and testing)
* enhancement: the GTA extension is now loaded asynchronically by Visual Studio; the drawback is that support for Visual Studio 2012 had to be dropped ([#243](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/243))
* enhancement: the *Show release notes* option has been removed, and this release notes dialog has been slightly changed and now has very funny buttons ([#270](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/270))
* maintenance: reduced code duplication of streaming and batch output parsers ([#263](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/263))
* donations: thanks, John and Jean-Michel - I appreciate it!
